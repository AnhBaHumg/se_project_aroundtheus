**Intro**
  
This project called "Around The U.S" which is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  

** Section: Adaptive Web Design and Working with Layouts
* Description:  Work with designs in a graphics editor called Figma
                Create responsive websites using Grid Layout
                Use media queries to set parameters for different screen sizes
                Work more efficiently with Git and the command line

** Section: Basic JavaScript and Working with the DOM
* Description:  The basics of JavaScript.
                Manipulate HTML and CSS through JavaScript.
                Create your array of data
                Add markup code for the modal window
                Access and toggle the modal window

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
